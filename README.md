# smym

smym or short for "show me your money" is a little tool to manage pettycash.

It's goal is to notify users over Slack about their current balance, while preserving the privacy of each user and only allowing one person to update them.

This project was created with Victoria Leus, who did the lovely design.

The project is still in a "pre useful" state, even though most of the functionality is in place, but is missing an "application wrapper" since the current implementation would be not safe in a browser context, with a new pettycash policy and corona related remote work of the whole office, the daily need shrank.

I plan to finish it one day, since I want to play with webview, but it's not on my top priorities at the moment.
